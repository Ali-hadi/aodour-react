Steampod?</b></p>

                  <p ><b  >The </b><b
                  >Steampod</b><span
                  > is the result of a collaboration between
                      L’Oréal Professionnel and the technology experts at Rowenta. It is a hand-held
                      device that, when glided down the hair, uses steam to smooth the hair fibres,
                      making them look glossier and more manageable. And when it comes to how to use,
                      Steampod is simple. It’s so easy, in fact, that we’ve put together 6 basic
                      steps for creating a wide range of hairstyles. Not just for straight hair, the
Steampod is the next generation of versatile hair styling tools!</span></p>

Steampod </b></p>

                  <p ><span  >L’Oréal
                  Professionnel is always looking to improve even its most successful products,
                  and the latest Steampod is an example of these efforts. The water tank is part
                  of the device itself, designed to prevent leakage and for easy transportation.
                  The tool is super light and thin and has a practical 360° rotating cord to make
                  styling even easier (creating waves is now hassle-free). Another major
                  innovation: the steam nozzles have been moved to between the comb and the
plates for better concentration and reduced steam loss.</span></p>

                      <p ><span  >Starting
                      at eye-level, curl 1-5cm sections of hair around the Steampod and gently twist
                      as you glide it down the hair. Once all the hair has been curled, let it cool,
                      then shake out and brush through with a wide-toothed comb to relax the curls
into shiny waves. </span><u><span  >Watch

effect: How to use Steampod for super straight hair</b></p>

                      <p ><u><span  >For glass

                          beginning at the roots, take 1cm sections of hair and squeeze the Steampod
                          gently as you slowly move it down the hair, all the way to the tips. Pull it
                          slightly towards you (or dip your head slightly forward when straightening) so
                          that the hair falls naturally in front of the ears. Brush through with a paddle
brush when finished.</span></p>

volume? How to use Steampod for maximum body</b></p>

                      <p ><span  >It’s a
                      simple technique, but one that makes all the difference. Take a small section
                      of dry hair and lift from the roots so that it is at a 90° angle. Holding the
                      ends, guide the Steampod up the hair from the roots to the tips and let it cool
                      slightly while still holding. Release and repeat across all the hair. For a
last boost of volume, flick your hair forward and back once.</span></p>
