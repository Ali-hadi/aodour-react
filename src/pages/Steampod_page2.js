                  Isn’t the clue in the name? They’re for straightening… Right? Actually, your
                  flat irons are more versatile than you might think. They should really be
                    called “smoothers” because, as well as straightening the hair, they can also be used to create different kinds of waves and curls on all hair types!</span>

                    Start curling on the lower sections and pin back the top pieces. Underneath the ear and behind the temple is a good place to start.</span>
                  </p>

                    When using a Steampod hair straightener, check for the arrows on the tool – these should always be pointing towards the ends of the hair when you style.</span>

                    Apply heat protection (e.g. Liss Unlimited Primrose Oil or Mythic Oil for fine
                        to normal hair) to the hair then fully blowdry before using your hair straightener. </span>
